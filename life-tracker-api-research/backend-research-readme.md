Disclaimer: None of the environment variables here or node_modules were omitted since this code was only for RESEARCH PURPOSES.
In the actual code, it would be wise to make a .gitignore file and include all of them there.

This code correctly registers a user within a database, and can login the user and provide them with a cookie with their own JWT, which is renewed every entry.
More details and research ought to be done on considering how to properly authenticate a user, but this code works.

Tested on Insomnia.
